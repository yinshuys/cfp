# STDTI&ID COMPASS 2021
## Symposium Overview

（Seminar on Traffic driven network threat identification and intrusion detection）

The Symposium focuses on Traffic driven network threat identification and intrusion detection.It provides an exchange platform for scholars in the field of network security, and can quickly understand the development status and future development direction of this field.

I hope all the researchers can actively participate in this symposium and bring wonderful papers.The symposium will last for three days and will be presented in the form of paper review, round table discussion and results presentation.

24 May – 28 May 2022

## Introduce

Cyberspace has become the "fifth frontier" after land, ocean, sky and space. As one of the key national information infrastructures, the Internet has played an important role in politics, military, economy, transportation and other fields. At the same time, the frequency and scale of network attacks are increasing year by year. These attacks have caused huge economic losses, and even seriously threatened national security and social stability and development. Therefore, how to effectively prevent attacks from the network has become an urgent problem.
    
At present, the existing security protection schemes include firewall, data encryption, intrusion detection system and other technologies, which can effectively sense network attacks to a certain extent and provide response decisions for security managers. With the continuous development of network intrusion technology, Trojans, zombies and other means of attack, as well as the diversification of network applications and computer programs, the efficiency of traditional virus library and pattern recognition detection methods has gradually decreased, but no matter what kind of attack methods, as long as the use of the network media, its attack behavior will be shown in the network traffic, the impact of network traffic Mining has become the first defense line of cyberspace protection and the main battlefield of intrusion detection.

With the continuous development of cloud storage technology and big data mining technology, the speed, efficiency and accuracy of online and offline traffic analysis have been improved. With the combination of machine learning and deep learning, migration learning, traffic threat identification and intrusion detection, the main battlefield of network countermeasure of traffic detection has ushered in new development. Researchers in academia and industry are coping with the new challenges in cyberspace with more intelligent and higher speed.

This seminar (stdti & ID) is collecting original technical papers to deal with threat identification in various network application scenarios and network topology environment, and network intrusion detection. It is expected to use more intelligent modes and methods, use artificial intelligence technology, optimize the existing detection technology, or solve the main problems of current traffic in storage management, flow, identification and other aspects The requirements include but are not limited to the following topics:
